# GRC / ATO Authorization Package (Sanitized Portfolio)

## Executive Overview
This repository presents a sanitized Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) authorization support package aligned with NIST RMF and NIST 800-53. It demonstrates hands-on experience in SSP development, security control assessments, continuous monitoring, audit readiness, and enterprise risk management across hybrid cloud and on-prem environments.

## Scope of Work Demonstrated
- System Security Plan (SSP) development and maintenance
- Security Control Assessment (SCA) support
- POA&M tracking and remediation coordination
- Continuous Monitoring (ConMon) strategy
- Audit and compliance documentation
- Risk assessments and control validation

## Framework Alignment
- NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
- NIST 800-53 Rev. 4/5
- FedRAMP-aligned practices
- FISMA compliance support

## Documentation Artifacts (Sanitized)
- SSP Excerpts
- Security Assessment Report (SAR) Samples
- POA&M Templates
- Security Policies and Procedures
- Continuous Monitoring Strategy

## Tools & Environments Referenced
- Qualys VMDR (Vulnerability Management)
- ServiceNow (GRC & Workflow Tracking)
- AWS / Hybrid Cloud Environments
- Enterprise Infrastructure (400+ systems context)
- Container Security & Compliance Oversight (Conceptual Alignment)

## Key Outcomes
- Accelerated authorization timelines through structured SSP and documentation
- Improved audit readiness and compliance posture
- Reduced risk exposure through continuous monitoring and remediation tracking
- Strengthened control traceability across multiple systems

## Repository Structure (Planned)
- /docs → SSP excerpts, policies, compliance documents
- /control-mapping → NIST 800-53 control mapping samples
- /evidence → Sanitized screenshots and assessment artifacts
